This document provides an overview of the two different ways to access and work with the project files: using the CSV and Python files separately, or using the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file in Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.

Option 1: CSV and Python Files
Files Included
ad_clicks.csv: This CSV file contains the dataset used in the project.
a:b_test.py: This Python script file contains the code for analyzing and processing the data.
Steps to Use
CSV Data: The ad_clicks.csv file holds the raw data that the project is based on. You can open this file using any spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or similar. This view provides a tabular representation of the data and allows for manual inspection.

Python Script: The a:b_test.py file contains the Python code responsible for data analysis, processing, and potentially generating visualizations or results. To use this code:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the script using the command: python a:b_test.py.
The script might print or save the results, generate visualizations, or perform other tasks based on the project's purpose.

Option 2: Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code
Files Included
a_b.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the entire project, including both explanatory text and code cells.
Steps to Use
Jupyter Notebook
Install Jupyter Notebook: If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can install it using the command: pip install jupyter.

Open the Notebook:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the command: jupyter notebook.
This will open your default web browser, showing the project directory.
Click on the a_b.ipynb file to open and interact with the notebook.
You can run individual code cells by selecting them and clicking the "Run" button or using Shift + Enter.

Visual Studio Code
Install Visual Studio Code: If you don't have Visual Studio Code installed, download it from the official website and follow the installation instructions.

Open the Notebook:

Open Visual Studio Code.
Install the "Python" extension if you haven't already.
Navigate to the project directory.
Open the a_b.ipynb file.
You can run code cells by clicking the "Run Cell" button (or Shift + Enter) within each cell.
